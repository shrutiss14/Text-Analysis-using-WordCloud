# Text-Analysis-using-WordCloud
This project analyzes 10 years of UN Secretary General speeches by creating word clouds using Python. It involves cleaning the text, 
removing stopwords, and generating visual representations where word size indicates frequency. 
The word clouds highlight recurring themes in the speeches over the span of 10 years.
